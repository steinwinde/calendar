# calendar
LWC calendar, with a look similar to Salesforce's Event Calendar.

Not yet supported:

- Support of mobile devices
- A second mini-calendar for independent date choices and quick navigation
- Support of being inserted in the sidebar
- Consistent colour scheme
- Event types that appear (colour) and behave (e.g. read-only vs. read-write) differently from each other
- Day view
- Year view

Known issues:

- Titles of events, if exceeding the length of the event, appear outside of the event
- Inconsistent language output (sometimes the language of texts depends on the current user (week day names), sometimes on constants
- Likely time zones and in particular first-day-of-week behaviour incorrect (calendar is designed for a country with Monday as first day of week)

Any sort of input welcome.
